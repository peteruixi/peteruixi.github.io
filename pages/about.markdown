Hi, my name is Ruixi Li, my friends call me peter or pete. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering this summer from Illinois Institute of Technology. I am currently looking for graduate programs in the states or job offering in the greater souther China area. 
    
My field of interest is in computer architecture, parallel computing and computer security. I will continue to challenge myself to be more creative and productive, even if I don't find a position where I could receive guidance.  I would still strive for better myself. 
                                                             
Btw, I'm a chill dude who is into a lot of things: Sports (litereally all kinds), Gaming(console & PC), Music of all genres, Film making, Photography, Clothing and Fashion etc. Yea, I like exploring things in this world, I don't think there is one thing that uninterests me.
