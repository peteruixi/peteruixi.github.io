Hi there, to whomever is reading this post. 
Welcome to my site! To find out more about myself, feel freen to explore the about tab as it will be fill with a lot more content.

In this post I would like to cover a couple of "new year resolutions" I have for the year of 2020. For all of the resolutions I planned on mentioning in this blog post, I am determine to achieve majority of them to debunk my impression of people's "new year resolutions". This is my first time blogging and really substantiate my commitments. I am hoping in this way, I could be more motivated and be more aware of myself.

1. Learn more about Computers
    I have just graduated college with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology. One thing I learned in my four years of college is that learning never stops. I've been slacking for the past couple of months because of grad school application, family matters, but I am hoping to pick up my thirst for knowledge and momentum of studying once more. 

    Here are the ways I would do to achieve mhy goals:
    - Posting my novicey analysis on academic paper at least monthly
    - Attempting various open source projects 
    - Sharing my booknotes on online lectures and textbooks
    - Summarizing my weekly learning experience at my internship position 

    I would be most likely focusing on computer architecture, machine learning, parallel programming, operating systems and image processing

2. Acquire new skills, expand the variety of knowledge base 
    I wish to become verstaile in more aspects. Hence, I signed up for driver school and will work my way to my driver's license finally. And I have also try to spend a minimum of 20mins per day on language learning app and start learning japanese, as I am a big fan of japanese culture.

3. Be in a better physical shape
    I longing burden of my is my physical condition. I have always been a large dude. Being a large dude has it's fair share of benefits but I would like to change it for the better of my health in the future. Towards the end of my undergrad, I am starting to realize the importance of maintaining one's body.
    

That being said, I would try to not let words and determination go to vain, I will continuously post my journey on this blog, stay tune.
