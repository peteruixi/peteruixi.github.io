Welcome to my site! To find out more about myself, feel freen to explore the about tab as it will be fill with a lot more content.</p>

<p>In this post I would like to cover a couple of ‚Äúnew year resolutions‚Äù I have for the year of 2020. For all of the resolutions I planned on mentioning in this blog post, I am determine to achieve majority of them to debunk my impression of people‚Äôs ‚Äúnew year resolutions‚Äù. This is my first time blogging and really substantiate my commitments. I am hoping in this way, I could be more motivated and be more aware of myself.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Learn more about Computers
 I have just graduated college with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology. One thing I learned in my four years of college is that learning never stops. I‚Äôve been slacking for the past couple of months because of grad school application, family matters, but I am hoping to pick up my thirst for knowledge and momentum of studying once more.</p>

    <p>Here are the ways I would do to achieve mhy goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Posting my novicey analysis on academic paper at least monthly</li>
      <li>Attempting various open source projects</li>
      <li>Sharing my booknotes on online lectures and textbooks</li>
      <li>Summarizing my weekly learning experience at my internship position</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I would be most likely focusing on computer architecture, machine learning, parallel programming, operating systems and image processing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acquire new skills, expand the variety of knowledge base 
 I wish to become verstaile in more aspects. Hence, I signed up for driver school and will work my way to my driver‚Äôs license finally. And I have also try to spend a minimum of 20mins per day on language learning app and start learning japanese, as I am a big fan of japanese culture.</p>

    <p>Be in a better physical shape
 I longing burden of my is my physical condition. I have always been a large dude. Being a large dude has it‚Äôs fair share of benefits but I would like to change it for the better of my health in the future. Towards the end of my undergrad, I am starting to realize the importance of maintaining one‚Äôs body.</p>
