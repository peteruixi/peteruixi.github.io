I"8<p>Hi, my name is Ruixi Li, my friends call me peter or pete.  I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering this summer from Illinois Institute of Technology.  I am currently looking for graduate programs in the states or job offering in the southern China area. 
My field of interest is in computer architecture, parallel computing and computer security. I will continue to challenge myself to be more creative and productive. Even if I don’t find a position where I could receive guidance, I would still strive for better myself.</p>

<p>Btw, I’m a chill dude who is into a lot of things: Sports (litereally all kinds), Gaming(console &amp; PC), Music of all genres, Film making, Photography, Clothing and Fashion etc. Yea, I like exploring things in this world, I don’t think there is one thing that uninterests me. Hit up my social if you find me a decent dude to talk with.</p>

<p>I am currently unemployed on standby, waiting for graduate school offers. By the looks of it, I would be updating my blog regularly just to keep myself busy.</p>
